# DeepSeek Chat Application Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to deploy the production version of the DeepSeek chat application to GitHub Pages.

## Step 1: Configure Vite for GitHub Pages

Update your `vite.config.js` file to set the base URL to your repository name. For example, if your repository is located at `https://github.com/roryp/deepseek-r1-webgpu`, modify the configuration as follows:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/deepseek-r1-webgpu/',
  plugins: [tailwindcss(), react()],
});
```

## Step 2: Branch Setup

Create a new branch called `gh-pages`, or configure your CI to build and push to `gh-pages`.

## Step 3: Updated Build Process

Modify your build scripts to generate production-ready artifacts (e.g., minification, bundling). Ensure the output folder (e.g., `dist` or `build`) is correctly placed for deployment.

## Step 4: Commit and Push

Commit the generated build files. Push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Step 5: GitHub Pages Configuration

In your GitHub repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and set `gh-pages` as the source.

## Step 6: View Your Site

Access your published site at `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>`.

## Step 7: Build the Production Version

Generate a production build to create an optimized output in the dist folder by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Step 8: Deploy to GitHub Pages using gh-pages

Install gh-pages:
Ensure that the gh-pages package is installed as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

## Step 9: Check the deploy script in package.json

Confirm that your package.json includes the following deploy script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
  // ...existing code...
}
```

8. Use gh-pages to deploy:
  ```sh
  npm run deploy
  ```

## Advanced Deployment Strategies and Optimizations

### Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline

To automate the deployment process, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        run: npm run deploy
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Optimizing Build Performance

To optimize the build performance, consider the following tips:

1. **Code Splitting**: Use code splitting to break your application into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand. This can improve the initial load time of your application.

2. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure that your build process removes unused code. Vite and other modern build tools support tree shaking out of the box.

3. **Minification**: Minify your JavaScript and CSS files to reduce their size. Vite automatically minifies the production build.

4. **Caching**: Use caching strategies to improve the performance of your application. Configure your server to cache static assets and use cache busting techniques to ensure that users always get the latest version of your files.

5. **Image Optimization**: Optimize your images to reduce their size without compromising quality. Use tools like `imagemin` to automate this process.

6. **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load non-critical resources to improve the initial load time of your application. This can include images, videos, and other assets that are not immediately needed.

7. **Analyze Bundle Size**: Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to analyze the size of your bundles and identify areas for improvement.

By following these advanced deployment strategies and optimizations, you can ensure that your application is performant and scalable.
